                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
                    typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
                    standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
                    printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
                    type specimen book.

                    Where does it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem
                    Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
                    classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000
                    years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
                    Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the
                    more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
                    passage, and going through the cites of the word in
                    classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source./p>
